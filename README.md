**1.** wifi-key-grab.ino:<br>
Starts cmd in a small window in order to grabs less attention

**2.** wifi-key-grab-min.ino:<br>
Starts cmd in a small window but also hides the cmd by scrolling it down the screen method defined in hak5darren's rubberducky wiki [Payload hide cmd window](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payload---hide-cmd-window)
